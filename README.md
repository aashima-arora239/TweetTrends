# elastictweetmap
A scalable tweet map using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Elasticsearch

Components: 
- Tweet stream: Stream tweets with geo-location in push-message fashion using [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.4.0/streaming_how_to.html).
- [AWS Elasticsearch](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=elasticsearch_2015&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=elasticsearch_service_b&sc_content=elasticsearch_p&sc_detail=aws%20elastic%20search&sc_category=elasticsearch&sc_segment=96544045594&sc_matchtype=p&sc_country=US): Persistent storage and index for tweets.
- Amazon SQS: Message queuing service that alerts webapp when a new tweet has beefo1und. 
- Django backend: Fetches tweets in realtime as well as those stored persistently and displays them onto the front-end. 
- Front-end: Maps API and Ajax calls.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: For load balancing.

AWS Elasticsearch instance: [URL]('https://search-es-twitter-yarekxa5djp3rkj7kp735gvacy.us-west-2.es.amazonaws.com/'). [Elasticsearch Python API](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is used to connect with the instance. Use the [Sense plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense-beta/lhjgkmllcaadmopgmanpapmpjgmfcfig?hl=en) to query the Elasticsearch instance for debug. [Link to JSON tutorial](http://joelabrahamsson.com/elasticsearch-101/) for querying Elasticsearch.

The following are skimmed from the twitter stream and inserted into elastic search:
- id
- text
- twitter handle
- timestamp
- coordinates
- place
